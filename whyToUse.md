# Why to Use this




>**#1**:  When (and why) you should use ES6 arrow functions

It is important to note 
that arrow functions are anonymous,

which means that they are not named

**This anonymity creates some issues:**
- Harder to debug
- No self-referencing
- 
  **Main benefit: No binding of ‘this’**
-
